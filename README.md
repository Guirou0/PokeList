# PokeList
 A pokedex inspired project that lists all pokemons from gen I to gen V and shows their informations.
 
   The purpose of this project was to train my abilities with the HTML, CSS and Javascript technologies.
   
   The project uses the PokeAPI, which is a open Restful API that provides a huge amount of information about pokemons. The main language of the project is portuguese, but there are a few things like the name of the moves and abilities that are in english.
   The index page of the project is a list that shows the pokemons from gen I to gen V and their basic characteristics, like name and their types.

   If you click on a pokemon, you are redirect to a page that shows further characteristics about that pokemon, like abilities, moves and stats.
